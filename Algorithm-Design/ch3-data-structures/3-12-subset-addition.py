# take the first number and subtract k from it and call that test_target. If test_target equals zero return that number. Otherwise, use black box on the remaining numbers to see if there is a subset that equals test_target. If true push first number to answer array and make k = test_target. Else k remains the same you repeat the process for the next number. At the end answer array will be a subset that equals k.
